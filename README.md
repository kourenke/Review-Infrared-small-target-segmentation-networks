# Review-Infrared-small-target-segmentation-networks
This work can not only help beginners quickly understand the research status and development trend of this field, but also can be used as a reference for other researchers.
We will upload the trained 13 segmentation network models (.pkl) and the comparative experimental data.
At the same time, we have carried out anchor box annotation for the existing 5 open infrared small target data sets, and the annotation data will be uploaded soon.
