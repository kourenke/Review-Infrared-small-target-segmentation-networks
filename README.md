1. We have uploaded the label files of 5 public single frame data sets.

      Data set 1 is derived from "Miss Detection vs. False Alarm: Adversarial Learning for Small Object Segmentation in Infrared Images".

      Data set 2 is derived from "AGPCNet: Attention-Guided Pyramid Context Networks for Infrared Small Target Detection".

      Data set 3 is derived from "Asymmetric Contextual Modulation for Infrared Small Target Detection".

      Data set 4 is derived from "Dense Nested Attention Network for Infrared Small Target Detection".

      Data set 5 is derived from "ISNet: Shape Matters for Infrared Small Target Detection".

2. We have uploaded the inference code of infrared small target segmentation, which can directly load pkl files.

3. We have uploaded a lot of pictures of the comparison experiment.
