# Review-Infrared-small-target-segmentation-networks
We will upload the trained 13 segmentation network models (.pkl) and the comparative experimental data.
At the same time, we have carried out anchor box annotation for the existing 5 open infrared small target data sets, and the annotation data will be uploaded soon.

Data set 1 is derived from "Miss Detection vs. False Alarm: Adversarial Learning for Small Object Segmentation in Infrared Images".

Data set 2 is derived from "AGPCNet: Attention-Guided Pyramid Context Networks for Infrared Small Target Detection".

Data set 3 is derived from "Asymmetric Contextual Modulation for Infrared Small Target Detection".

Data set 4 is derived from "Dense Nested Attention Network for Infrared Small Target Detection".

Data set 5 is derived from "ISNet: Shape Matters for Infrared Small Target Detection".
